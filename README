This is a crude NTSC generator, which I wrote in order to provide rudimentary
graphics capabilities for my nopCPU project. Currently, it is only capable of
producing black and white video. In order to use this in a real circuit,
configure dacout to use 5V TTL logic levels, and connect it to your TV's 
composite input based on the following diagram:


             |----|
--dacout(1)--|450Ω|---|
             |----|   |
                      |
                      |
                      |
              |----|  |
--dacout(0)---|900Ω|--|-----TV in---
              |----|

PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR *ANY* DAMANGES THAT MIGHT ARISE AS
A RESULT OF USING THIS MODULE, INCLUDING DAMAGES TO LIFE AND/OR PROPERTY!!!

TODO:

(1) Test it with an actual TV (Timing looks OK in simulation :>)
(2) Implement a proper character generator over this thing
(3) Add colo(u)r!

Due to the wide variety of FPGA vendors and synthesis tools, I cannot provide
specific instructions on synthesizing and using this piece of code. However,
please do keep in mind that this generator has been designed for use with a
10 MHz clock. Any different frequency will result in timing errors.

If all you want is to test the timing of the module, you will need iverilog
and a vcd viewer (in my opinion, gtkwave is quite a fine tool for this job).
Invoke iverilog in the following way:

iverilog gen_tb.v gen.v -o ntsc_gen

Then, run ntsc_gen, and stop it after the desirable amount of time units
has passed, by pressing CTRL+C and then typing "finish" in the command
prompt that appears.

That's all folks, have a lot of fun!
